A "simple" Django 1.0 application that supports basic chat features, like:
  * sending messages
  * join/leave notifications

**Other features are on the way**
  * system notifications
  * special events
  * actions (like in IRC's... "/me slaps john with a trout!")

Use it, share it, improve it, tell me if you liked it, and of any possible improvements.
